                <p class="card-text">The purpose of this project is to look for a relationship between the latitude of a city and the weather that you might experience. We are of course looking for variables that might be predicted by the latitude.</p>
                <p class="card-text">After assembling and cleaning the data, I found that only the Max temperature of a city is predicted by the latitude. Latitude does not appear to be predictive of: Cloudiness, Humidity and Wind Speed. But don't take my word for it, you can find the other visualizations and the raw data here on this site.</p>
